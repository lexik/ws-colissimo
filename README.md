This library provides a client for the SOAP 
[WSColiPosteLetterService](https://www.coliposte.fr/pro/docs/docutheque/divers/socolissimo/integrationwsshipping.pdf).

Access to the WSColiPosteLetterService must be contracted with "La Poste" beforehand or 
it will simply not work. Also, note that currently only the production mode is working.

Nb: The structure of this library is based on 
[PHPForce Soap Client](https://github.com/phpforce/soap-client).

```
{
    "require": {
        "lexik/ws-colissimo": "dev-master"

```
Install it by running the command :

```
php composer.phar update lexik/ws-colissimo
```
